# Challenge10-Team-Profile-Generator

# Description
The purpose of this project is to generate a team profile by using Node.js to provide
information regarding a company's employees' contact information. This is done by answering basic
questions provided in the terminal. Once all of the questions have been answered, a web page
containing all of the contacts whose information was entered will be displayed.

# How to Install and Run the Project:
Before answering the questions, install npm i and jest and run your npm tests to make sure they are
all passed.

Next, launch the project by typing in node index.js and begin answering the questions. To navigate between
employee categories use the arrow buttons.

When finished, open up the index.html file and launch it to the web. You'll see the employee cards containing
all the data you've entered.

# Usage
This can be used to help create an employee directory, or any kind of directory where members' contact info
within an organization is needed.
